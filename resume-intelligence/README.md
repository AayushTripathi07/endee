# Resume Intelligence System using Endee Vector Database

## Project Overview

This project implements a semantic resume search engine using the Endee Vector Database. It enables recruiters and hiring systems to search and retrieve resumes based on natural language queries rather than exact keyword matches.

Traditional resume screening relies on keyword matching, which often misses relevant candidates due to differences in wording. This system solves that problem using vector embeddings and semantic similarity, allowing more intelligent and accurate candidate retrieval.

The application uses Endee as the vector database backend to store resume embeddings and perform similarity-based search efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Recruiters often need to search through hundreds or thousands of resumes to find suitable candidates. Keyword-based filtering is inefficient and fails to capture semantic meaning.

Challenges include:

* Keyword mismatch between resumes and job descriptions
* Large volume of resumes
* Inefficient manual screening
* Lack of semantic understanding

This project addresses these challenges by:

* Converting resumes into vector embeddings
* Storing embeddings in Endee vector database
* Performing semantic similarity search using natural language queries

### System Components

#### 1. User Interface

* Built using Streamlit
* Allows users to upload resumes
* Allows users to search resumes using natural language

#### 2. Resume Parser

* Extracts text from PDF resumes
* Uses PyPDF2 for parsing

#### 3. Embedding Generator

* Uses Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
* Converts resume text and queries into 384-dimensional vectors

#### 4. Vector Database (Endee)

* Stores vector embeddings of resumes
* Performs fast similarity search
* Handles vector indexing and retrieval

#### 5. Search Engine

* Converts user query into vector
* Searches Endee database
* Returns ranked resumes based on similarity

## Technical Approach

### Step 1: Resume Indexing

1. User uploads resumes
2. Resume text is extracted
3. Embeddings are generated using transformer model
4. Embeddings are stored in Endee vector database

### Step 2: Semantic Search

1. User enters search query
2. Query converted into embedding
3. Endee performs similarity search
4. Most relevant resumes returned

## How Endee Vector Database is Used

Endee serves as the core vector storage and retrieval system.

Endee is used for:

* Creating vector index
* Storing resume embeddings
* Performing similarity search
* Efficient vector retrieval

### Endee Operations Used

#### Index Creation

```
POST /api/v1/index/create
```

#### Vector Insertion

```
POST /api/v1/index/resumes/vector/insert
```

#### Vector Search

```
POST /api/v1/index/resumes/search
```

Endee enables efficient semantic search across resume embeddings with high performance.
